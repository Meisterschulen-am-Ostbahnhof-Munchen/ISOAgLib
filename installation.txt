\section HowtoSetupCompilerTools Preparing Compiler and IDE

The \isoaglib requires standard conformant C++ compilers with a
conformant implementation of the <i>Standard Template Library (STL)</i>.<br>
<b>Please note:</b> an installation of the <a href="http://stlport.sourceforge.net/">STLport library</a>,
is not required for the current versions of \isoaglib anymore.


\subsection CompKdevelop3 KDevelop3 for Linux

The usage of \isoaglib is quite easy with Linux. As this platform is used by <a href="mailto:Achim.Spangler_at_osb-ag:de">Achim Spangler</a>,
a first hand support is possible. The fine IDE named kdevelop (see http://www.kdevelop.org) provides
code completion, class browser, integrated debugger and several features more.
There are some basic kdevelop3 projects in <tt>compiler_projects/kdevelop_tmake/IsoAgLib</tt> . In case of problems,
<a href="mailto:Achim.Spangler_at_osb-ag:de">Achim Spangler</a> can help with some more examples.<br>
The project files, which can be created by a helper tool of the \isoaglib, can be compiled very easily
with standard GNUmake.

\subsection CompDevVc6 Microsoft Visual Studio 6 and later
The automatic project file generating script can write DSP project files, which can be directly used to create an executeable .exe
program with <i>Vector-Informatik CAN card</i> support (or other CAN cards). As newer versions of VC++ can also import DSP project files,
no special support is provided here. However, several project files for Visual Studio 2005 have been created as well.<br>
Remark: Be sure that <tt>windows.h</tt> from the Microsoft PlatformSKD is included in your include path. It is needed for compilation of several tutorial examples. You can download the Windows Server 2003 R2 Platform SDK <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=484269E2-3B89-47E3-8EB7-1F2BE6D7123A&displaylang=en">here</a>.

\subsubsection Vc6StlPort Installation of STLport - Open Source ANSI C++ compatible STL
The current \isoaglib version doesn't require the <a href="http://stlport.sourceforge.net/">STLport library</a> anymore.
<!--<b>Important:</b>
The VC++ version 6 has no ANSI C++ compatible version of the <i>Standard Template Library (STL)</i> on board, so that
the STLport must be installed and used for \isoaglib. STLport is not needed with later versions of MS VC++.

<a href="http://stlport.sourceforge.net/">STLport</a> is meanwhile a very well known and accepted implementation of the STL standard.
It is used by commercial IDEs like Borland C++ Builder 6 and Tasking EDE (since version 8.0).

Installation Steps:
-# download the latest STLport version from <a href="http://stlport.sourceforge.net/Download.shtml">stlport.sourceforge.org</a> or <a href="http://www.stlport.org/archive/STLport-4.6.2.tar.gz">download version 4.6.2</a> directly.
-# extract the archive to a location like <tt>C:\\</tt> (or use another directory), then change the following examples according to your individual path
-# <b>rename directory <tt>C:\\STLport-4.6.2</tt> to <tt>C:\\STLport</tt> , so that the scripts and automatically created paths needn't be adapted to new versions of STLport</b>
-# Configure and install STLport
	- with native IOSTREAMS of VC6 (<b>recommended</b>):
		- simply uncomment the <tt>\#define _STLP_NO_OWN_IOSTREAMS</tt> in the config header <tt>C:\\STLport\\stlport\\stl_user_config.h</tt>
		- edit <tt>C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\VC98\\Bin\\vcvars32.bat</tt>
			- FROM: <tt>set INCLUDE=%MSVCDir%\\ATL\\INCLUDE; %MSVCDir%\\INCLUDE;%MSVCDir%\\MFC\\INCLUDE;%INCLUDE%</tt>
			- TO:   <tt>set INCLUDE=C:\\STLport\\stlport;%MSVCDir%\\ATL\\INCLUDE; %MSVCDir%\\INCLUDE;%MSVCDir%\\MFC\\INCLUDE;\\%INCLUDE%</tt>
		- add <tt>C:\\STLport\\stlport</tt> <b>in FRONT of the include path of your projects - this is already done for automatically created DSP files</b>
		- That's it! (no compile or install of sources needed)
	- with IOSTREAMS version of STLport:<br>
		use installation overview from http://doc.ece.uci.edu/~mlai/notes/stlport_in_vc.html
		(the batch file <tt>vcvars32.bat</tt> is not located at <tt>C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\VC98</tt> but in <tt>C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\VC98\\Bin</tt>)
-# look at STLport's own documentation from local installation file://C:/STLport/doc/install.html and file://C:/STLport/doc/select_io.html for further information
-# make shure that you adapt the feature setup files to reflect a differing path to your STLport installation (<tt>C:\\STLport</tt> is default setting)-->


\subsection CompDevCpp Dev-C++ for Win32

<b>Important NEWS!!!:</b>
<i>
Newer Versions of Vector-Informatik CAN cards can be used with Dev-C++ generated Windows EXE programs (at least Vector-Informatik engineers
reported to have incorporated several Dev-C++ examples into their newest driver package). So please check for a new driver
version, when you want to use Dev-C++ with Vector-Informatik CAN cards. Please ask Vector-Informatik, in case you don't get
their tutorial programs to run with Dev-C++.
</i><br>


As <a href="mailto:Achim.Spangler_at_osb-ag:de">Achim Spangler</a> had several issues with MS Visual Studio, and the STL version of the standard <b>gcc</b> compiler
is quite good, <a href="mailto:Achim.Spangler_at_osb-ag:de">Achim Spangler</a> decided to maintain mainly the free IDE "Dev-C++" (http://www.bloodshed.net/dev/devcpp.html)
for Win32 platforms.
This IDE has some important features:
- simple install
- automatic update within the extras menu
- download of extension modules within easy to handle download and install dialog window
	(<b>important</b>: the tools for <b>vt2iso</b> compilation: <i>xerces</i> and the image manipulation libraries <i>FreeImage</i> and <i>ImLib</i> can be
	  downloaded and installed this way)
- project file format is a clean ASCII file, so that the project generation script can
    directly create a running project for Dev-C++

\subsubsection InstallDevCpp Installation of Dev-C++
-# Please download at least the version (4.9.9.2 with GCC 3.4.3) from http://www.bloodshed.net/dev/devcpp.html
-# Check for updates with Dev-C++ menu entry (TOOLS->CHECK FOR UPDATES)
    -# Select the mirror "PlanetMirror.com" from the list (at least the german version has a dead
	   default mirror entry in the list) in the dialog window "WebUpdate"
    -# Click on button "Check for updates" in the dialog window "WebUpdate"
    -# Select at least the following packages for download (as they are needed for <b>vt2iso</b>)
	   - FreeImage.DevPak
	   - ImageLib.DevPak
	   - <tt>xerces-c_2_5_0-mingw.DevPak</tt> (see special download instructions in \ref Win32Xerces)
	   - (optionally install further documentation or utility packages)


\subsection CompTasking TASKING for Embedded Targets
<a href="http://www.tasking.com/">TASKING</a> provides cross compilers for different target platforms that can be used
for \isoaglib appliations.

\subsubsection CompTasking70 Version 7.56
The TASKING compiler of version >= 7.56 is handling C++ in a sufficient manner and provides a conformant STL.
The used STL is based on the common SGI STL.
This compiler is the preferred version for <a href="http://www.sensor-technik.de/">STW</a> ECUs,
as only this version has been used for the quality certification for TUEV.

\subsubsection CompTasking8x Version 8.x
The TASKING compilers as of 8.0 were switched from SGI STL version to the newer version from STLport.
This supports creation of several compiled libraries for parts of STL, so that no more all STL elements are
managed as pure template (header based) code.
But the integration into 8.x series of STLport by TASKING is irritating. Please make sure that you <b>deactivate any
setting that would trigger linking of STLport libraries in <i>Project|Project Options|C++ Compiler|Libraries</i></b>. This should result
in the project files in the following settings:
- <tt> -nostl </tt> for <i>Do not link the STLport library</i>
- <tt> -nostlo </tt> for <i>Do not link the STLport extension library</i>

As soon as you have deactivated any linking of STLport libraries, you have to set the following <b>#defines</b> in your project file,
to get correct results with usage of any STL container like std::vector:
- <tt>_STLP_USE_NO_IOSTREAMS</tt>
- <tt>_STLP_NO_NEW_IOSTREAMS</tt>
- <tt>_STLP_NO_OWN_IOSTREAMS</tt>
- <tt>_STLP_HAS_NO_NEW_IOSTREAMS</tt>

<b>Background:</b>
Even the simple version of TASKING STLport library contains code for <i>iostream</i>, <i>locales</i> and <i>money format</i> (and much more).
Sadly the linker is not able to remove this dead code, so that the firmware gets bloated by about 136 kByte.
Surprisingly the RAM usage gets a little lower (about 10kByte), when the linking of the minimal STLport libary is activated.

But this could be also caused by the special test program.


<!--The following table shows a report with the data of RAM/ROM requests from the tutorial 3_0
with different compilation options.
<table>
<tr><th>compiler option        </th> <th>     </th> <th>RAM  </th> <th>ROM   </th> </tr>

You might find some more optimization hints at <a href="http://www.altium.com/TASKING/support/c166-classic/AN019-15_v8.PDF">Optimization Hints for your Application
TASKING C166/ST10 Tools</a>.

\subsubsection CompTaskingVX Version VX-Toolchain
We were not able to run our tests with TASKING VX-Toolchain and our STW ECUs, as TASKING switched their
library format to <b>ELF</b>. Thus the VX-Toolchain linker is no more able to link the libraries from the classic toolchain.

We were told by the support department of TASKING, that the STLport options would have been renamed, so that a user can easier detect
that the base STLport library contains <i>iostream</i> and the like.


<b>Please note:</b>
- STW recommends to stick with the 7.56 version futher on (because of TÜV certification)
- if you do not rely on TÜV certification it is safe to use the 8.x version (with the above settings)
- it is not recommended to use the latest version of the TASKING VX-Toolchain, because it uses a <i>completely different
  project file format</i> which has not yet been tested properly with \isoaglib.

\isoaglib also provides some project files for the tutorials which can be used by the TASKING compiler.

\subsubsection TaskingHeapsize Set Heapsize in Linker/Locator Specification (ILO file)
The \isoaglib stores some information in dynamic lists, so that you need some heap memory.
Please start with a great <tt>HEAPSIZE</tt> setting in the linker/locator specification (see </tt>HEAPSIZE</tt> control in <tt>ILO</tt> file), and
check the RS232 output, when you compile the project with the <tt>\#define DEBUG_HEAP_USEAGE</tt>.

\subsubsection TaskingCanRs232Buffer Allocate enough buffer for RS232 buffer
Some OS/BIOS which are designed like <a href="http://www.sensor-technik.de">STW BIOS</a> have a special setting to
allocate enough memory for the internal managed buffers for RS232. The amount of items which are reserved by
\isoaglib in <tt>isoaglib_config.h</tt>: <tt>CONFIG_RS232_DEFAULT_SND_PUF_SIZE</tt> (this can be overridden by
configuration call with <tt>iRS232IO_c::setSndPufferSize</tt> and <tt>iRS232IO_c::setRecPufferSize</tt>).<br>
- Check the RS232 output for fill grade of CAN buffers (the MAX amount of buffered CAN messages per BUS is printed)
- Calculate the needed memory for RS232 (corresponds to <tt>CONFIG_RS232_DEFAULT_SND_PUF_SIZE</tt> or the overridden value) and CAN (corresponds to the MAX output from step above)
- Adapt the buffer size value (leave some additional space)


\section HowtoCreateProjectFiles Project File Creation with update_makefile.sh

Caused by the huge amount of optional features in the \isoaglib, the manual
selection of needed project files can get quite complicated.
The script <tt>examples/compiler_projects/update_makefile.sh</tt> can create project files and
project specific configuration headers for all projects. The feature setup is feed to this script
by configuration files with a very simple syntax. Please have a look at the comments inside the several
<tt>conf_*</tt> files in the above mentioned directory.

Call the script like this:
- <tt>cd examples/compiler_projects/</tt>
- <tt>./update_makefile.sh conf_0_0_AddressClaimIso</tt>

Further command line switches of <tt>update_makefile.sh</tt> are described \ref ScriptOptions "below".


\subsection UseMSYS Running script on Win32 using MSYS
As scripts can only be natively executed in UNIX or Linux, the tool MSYS (http://www.mingw.org)
is needed as a minimal POSIX layer to call bash scripts within Win32.
This project is simply to install. You don't need the other tools from this website, as the
MinGW compiler is also integrated into the Dev-C++ tool.


\subsection ScriptIntegrateWin32Can Integration of Win32 CAN card drivers
The \isoaglib provides now also for Win32 the CAN server application with the following features:
-# several \isoaglib applications can run on the same host and communicate which each other through the CAN server (socket communication)
-# the connected \isoaglib appliactions can access a physical CAN bus via the CAN server application. Supported HW types are:
  - Peak CAN USB driver
  - Vector Informatik driver (<b>CANLIB</b> and <b>XL Driver Library</b>)
  - Sontheim CAN card driver
  - RTE CAN driver (linux only)
  - A1 CAN driver (linux only)

The necessary configuration options for the \isoaglib applications are (e.g. conf_0_0_AddressClaimIso):
- <tt>USE_CAN_DRIVER="socket_server"</tt>
- <tt>USE_CAN_DEVICE_FOR_SERVER="no_card"</tt>

Create your Dev-C++ or VC6 project with the <tt>update_makefile.sh</tt> script and build the project.

Precompiled CAN server binaries for Windows already exist in the following directories:
- Dev-C++:<br> 
  - <tt>examples/compiler_projects/Dev-C++/canserver/can_server.exe</tt>
  - <tt>examples/compiler_projects/Dev-C++/canserver/can_server_pcan.exe</tt>
  - <tt>examples/compiler_projects/Dev-C++/canserver/can_server_vector_xl.exe</tt>
- Visual-Studio (2005):
  - <tt>examples/compiler_projects/VC8/canserver/bin/can_server.exe</tt>
  - <tt>examples/compiler_projects/VC8/canserver/bin/can_server_d.exe</tt> (debug version)
  - <tt>examples/compiler_projects/VC8/canserver/bin/can_server_pcan.exe</tt>
  - <tt>examples/compiler_projects/VC8/canserver/bin/can_server_pcan_d.exe</tt> (debug version)
  - <tt>examples/compiler_projects/VC8/canserver/bin/can_server_vector_xl.exe</tt>
  - <tt>examples/compiler_projects/VC8/canserver/bin/can_server_vector_xl_d.exe</tt> (debug version)

To use <tt>can_server_pcan.exe</tt> (support for PEAK CAN card), you need <tt>pcan_usb.dll</tt> from http://www.peak-system.com/files/usb.zip.
The <tt>can_server_vector_xl.exe</tt> will require drivers that are available on the Vector driver CD.

\subsubsection CanServerInstallation CAN Server Build and Installation
If you wish to rebuild the CAN server applications you can use the following projects:
-# <tt>can_server.[dev|vcproj]</tt> (no access to a physical CAN bus, only for host internal communication)
-# <tt>can_server_pcan.[dev|vcproj]</tt> (support for Peak CAN card)
-# <tt>can_server_sontheim.[dev|vcproj]</tt> (support for Sontheim CAN card)
-# <tt>can_server_vector.[dev|vcproj]</tt> (support for Vector Informatik CAN card, CANLIB)
-# <tt>can_server_vector_xl.[dev|vcproj]</tt> (support for Vector Informatik CAN card, XL Driver Library)

These projects consist of:
-# Source file <tt>can_server_sock.cpp</tt> (main CAN server logic)
-# Source file { <tt>can_server_no_card.cpp | can_server_peak.cpp | can_server_sontheim.cpp | can_server_vector.cpp | can_server_vector_xl.cpp</tt> } (CAN card specific logic)

and the necessary pathes for CAN card specfic header files and libraries for compiling and linking. Please adapt the include pathes for header and libraries to your own settings (e.g.: <tt>C:\\Development\\pthread, C:\\Development\\PCAN, C:\\Development\\CANLIB, C:\\Development\\pthread, C:\\Development\\pthread\\pthreadVC2.lib,</tt> ...)

The project files are located in the directory <tt>IsoAgLib/examples/compiler_projects/Dev-C++/canserver</tt> and <tt>IsoAgLib/examples/compiler_projects/VC8/canserver</tt>.

This strategy can be mapped to other CAN cards as well. Please contact the
<a href="mailto:Achim.Spangler_at_osb-ag:de">Achim Spangler</a> for help on adaptation and please
send a running adaptation back to the project.

For building the CAN server application the following files are required:<br>
- <b>Pthreads</b>: (version 2.8.0 files can be downloaded from http://sources.redhat.com/pthreads-win32/)
    - <tt>pthread.h</tt>
    - <tt>libpthreadVC2.dll</tt>
    - <tt>libpthreadVC2.lib</tt>
    - <tt>sched.h</tt>
    - <tt>semaphore.h</tt>
- <b>PCAN</b>: (<a href="http://www.peak-system.com/files/usb.zip">usb.zip</a>)
    - <tt>Pcan_usb.h</tt>
    - <tt>Pcan_usb.lib</tt>
- <b>Vector-Informatik (XL Driver Library)</b>:
    - <tt>vxlapi.dll</tt>
    - <tt>vxlapi.h</tt>
    - <tt>vxlapi.lib</tt>
- <b>Vector-Informatik (CANLIB)</b>:
    - <tt>vcand32.dll</tt>
    - <tt>vcand32.lib</tt>
    - <tt>VCanD.h</tt>

You also have to install the .dll of the used CAN driver library into the DLL-Search-Path of your system (or into the directory of your resulting EXE).

<b>Some additional notes:</b><br>
It seemed that the driver DLLs for Vector-Informatik CAN cards don't interact with Dev-C++ built EXE programs. Please use the VC8 projects when building the CAN server application with Vector-Informatik support.

The CAN server application for Vector Informatik and Sontheim cards can be configured for a specific hardware type (list <tt>{ HWTYPE_VIRTUAL|HWTYPE_CANCARDX|HWTYPE_CANAC2|HWTYPE_CANAC2PCI }</tt> - the XL driver places the <tt>XL_</tt> string in front of the card type name, so that both CANLIB and XL can be used with the same conf_* type names). As a special option the CAN server can use all real hardware channels it finds, so that your EXE can be flexibly used for different CAN card types of Vector-Informatik. You can use this option, if you select <tt>HWTYPE_AUTO</tt> as hardware type. In case only the Vector-Informatik Virtual Channel is found, then these typically two channels are used instead. Please add the define <tt>-DUSE_CAN_CARD_TYPE=HWTYPE_...</tt> or <tt>-DUSE_CAN_CARD_TYPE=XL_HWTYPE_...</tt> to your project.<br>
The Sontheim CAN card driver should be used also with the automatic CAN card type detection. This is realized by testing the API init for
a list of supported CAN card types. As soon as the API is successfully initialized for one CAN card type, that type is used.<br>

<!--The IsoAgLib provides at the moment an integration with the CAN drivers from Vector Informatik and Sontheim.
Both Vector Informatik driver types <b>CANLIB</b> and <tt>XL Driver Library</tt> are supported by the source modules
<tt>target_extension_can_w32_vector_canlib.cpp</tt> and <tt>target_extension_can_w32_vector_xl_drv_lib.cpp</tt>.
Both modules support the usage of a thread based CAN receive, which can be activated by the
setting of the <tt>\#define USE_THREAD</tt> (if it's undef -> no threading is used).<br>
<b>Important:</b>
You can use one of the XL CAN cards with the <tt>CANLIB</tt> driver API. You can also use the <tt>XL Driver Library</tt>
for some of the older CAN cards (please look at the Vector-Informatik website for details).<br>
Therefore you have really to select <tt>vector_canlib</tt> for <tt>USE_CAN_DRIVER</tt>, if the SETUP.EXE of your driver
extracted the files to a subdirectory <tt>CANLIB</tt> - as you have obviously installed the CANLIB.<br>
Some users were already irritated by this difference, so that they weren't able to build the tutorial examples. So this is not
just a theoretic problem.<br>
</b>

The integration of the <i>Sontheim</t> CAN card driver <tt>target_extension_can_w32_sontheim_canlpt.cpp</tt> is comparable to the Vector Informatik case. But here, Sontheim placed
the API simply into a ZIP file which doesn't define a folder and doesn't provide a SETUP.EXE. Thus you should manually place the ZIP contents
to the path <b><tt>C:\\Development\\Sontheim</tt></b> , if you want to use the provided tutorial example project files without the need to call update_makefile.sh
for creation of adapted project files.

This strategy can be mapped to other Win32 or Linux CAN cards as well. Please contact
<a href="mailto:Achim.Spangler_at_osb-ag:de">Achim Spangler</a> for help on adaptation and please
send a running adaptation back to the project.

\subsection ScriptOptions Command Line Options for update_makefile.sh
The script <tt>update_makefile.sh</tt> provides several command line options which enables
individual overwriting of target specific project settings. Thus you can use a project config
file, which reflects for example a <tt>pc_linux</tt> platform, to get a project file for <tt>pc_win32</tt>
(Dev-C++ and Visual Studio VC6 DSP project file).
The following parameters are available (you can get this list by calling the script with
<tt>./update_makefile.sh --help</tt>).
\code
Usage: ./update_makefile.sh [OPTION] project_config_file
Create filelist, Makefile and configuration settings for a IsoAgLib project.

  -h, --help                        print this message and exit.
  --doxygen-export-directory=DIR    write the filelist and configuration files with doxygen documentation
                                    blocks to the given directory instead of the default directory of all generated files.
  --IsoAgLib-root=DIR               use the given root directory instead of the entry in the selected configuration file.
  --target-system=TARGET            produce the project definition files for the selected TARGET instead of the
                                    target which is specified in the configuration file
                                    ("pc_linux"|"pc_win32"|"esx"|"c2c"|"imi"|"pm167"|"mitron167").
  --pc-can-driver=CAN_DRIVER        produce the project definition files for the selected CAN_DRIVER if the project shall run on PC
                                    ( "simulating"|"sys"|"msq_server"|"socket_server", "msq_server" only for Linux)
  --pc-can-device-for-server=CAN_DEVICE_FOR_SERVER
                                    use this device for building the can_server
                                    ( "no_card"|"pcan"|"A1"|"rte"|"sontheim"|"vector_canlib"|"vector_xl" ).
  --pc-rs232-driver=RS232_DRIVER    produce the project definition files for the selected RS232_DRIVER if the project shall run on PC
                                    ("simulating"|"sys"|"rte").
  --little-endian-cpu               select configuration for LITTLE ENDIAN CPU type
  --big-endian-cpu                  select configuration for BIG ENDIAN CPU type

./compiler_projects/projectGeneration/update_makefile.sh parses the selected project configuration file and overwrites the default values for all contained settings.
It collects then the corresponding files which can then be imported to an individual IDE.
Additionally a project specific configuration header is created in the directory xgpl_src/IsoAgLib with the
name scheme ".config_<project_name>.h". If the \#define PRJ_USE_AUTOGEN_CONFIG is set to ".config_<project_name>.h",
the central configuration header xgpl_src/IsoAgLib/isoaglib_config.h will include this header.
Please set additionally the SYSTEM_FOO for the wanted platform - ./compiler_projects/projectGeneration/update_makefile.sh will output the correct define at the end of the
run.
Thus with these two DEFINE settings, the compiler can generate a clean running executable / HEX.

Report bugs to <Achim.Spangler_at_osb-ag:de>.

<li>selects all needed project file (thus you don't have do manually select the neded files,
	a big part of the files can be excluded for simple projects)</li>
<li>generate a project specific configuration header, which is placed in the directory

\subsection FeatureSetupFile Contents of Feature Setup File

The features and the corresponding source modules and configuration defines can be specified by configuration variables
in feature setup files. The variables can be grouped to several specification tasks.

The specification files for the tutorial examples list all configuration variables, even if just their
default value is used. The default state is OFF (value 0) for most variables. You don't have to write
the default values in the specification of your own project.

\subsubsection ConfProjectIdent Project Identification

The project can be identified by:
	- <tt>PROJECT</tt> project name, which is used for the project file and project directory
	- <tt>PROJECT_AUTHOR</tt> author name, which is inserted into project file (where this value is defined)
	- <tt>PROJECT_AUTHOR_EMAIL</tt> author email address, which is also inserted into project file (where this value is defined)
    - <tt>PRJ_INCLUDE_PATH</tt> use additional files that are needed for the projects ( parameter is found after the Applications Sources section)

\subsubsection ConfApplicationFiles Selection of Application Sources

The update_makefile.sh script can collect your individual source files into the project file of the wanted IDE.
This can be achived by the following settings.
	- <tt>REL_APP_PATH</tt> path in relation to <tt>IsoAgLib</tt> base directory to base directory of all application sources
			(use "../" to navigate to parent directory; use UNIX style directory separator "/" )
	- selection of source files in two alternative ways:
		-# <tt>APP_SRC_FILE</tt> list single files seperated by whitespace
		-# Use search expression which can be defined with:
			- <tt>APP_SEARCH_SRC_CONDITION</tt> file extensions to select as source module (default is "*.cc *.c *.cpp")
			- <tt>APP_SEARCH_HDR_CONDITION</tt> file extensions to select as header (default is "*.h *.hpp")
			- <tt>APP_PATH_EXLCUDE</tt> paths to exclude from search - you can use joker "*" to simply define only part of the to be excluded path
			- <tt>APP_SRC_EXCLUDE</tt> files to exclude from search - you can use joker "*" to exclude all files which match to a specific pattern (e.g. "test*.cpp")

\subsubsection ConfBaseSetting Basic Project Settings
The following basic settings can be specified independent from hardware and feature setup:
	- <tt>ISO_AG_LIB_PATH</tt> relative path from directory where the feature setup file is located to the root directory of \isoaglib ("../.." for the tutorial examples)
	- <tt>PRJ_DEFINES</tt> individual <tt>\#defines</tt> which are integrated into the project file - some examples for special debug purposes:
		- <tt>DEBUG_CAN_BUFFER_FILLING</tt> for RS232 output of MAX amount of buffered CAN messages
		                                  (important to decide on amount of items in the BIOS/OS CAN receive buffer)
		- <tt>DEBUG_HEAP_USEAGE</tt> for RS232 output of amount of bytes which are needed of one
		                           item in the different types of dynamic lists: IsoAgLib::MsgObj_c , IsoAgLib::FilterBox_c , IsoAgLib::IsoItem_c ,
		                           IsoAgLib::MeasureSubprog_c , SetpointRegister ;
		                           additionally print calculated amount of HEAP memory which is used by the several types of
		                           dynamic lists (output on each list change)
	- <tt>PRJ_SEND_DEBUG</tt> activate several \isoaglib internal debugging on RS232
	- <tt>USE_FLOAT_DATA_TYPE</tt> activate useage of float variable type (avoid useage of float in subfunctions process data, RS232 output, GPS decode)
	- <tt>OPTIMIZE_HEAPSIZE_IN_FAVOR_OF_SPEED</tt> reduce HEAP useage size in favour of speed. This can lead to HEAP memory fragmentation in worst-case scenarios. Default is OFF.

\subsubsection ConfBasicHwSetup Basic Hardware Setup
The basic hardware setup of your target (including CAN hardware/driver) can be defined in this group.
	- <tt>USE_TARGET_SYSTEM</tt> type of target system from list <tt>{ "pc_linux" | "pc_win32" | "esx" | "imi" | "pm167" | "mitron167" }</tt> or other coming supported HALs
    - <tt>PRJ_DO_NOT_START_RELAIS_ON_STARTUP</tt> prevent \isoaglib switching the system relais to ON on startup
    - <tt>PRJ_SYSTEM_WITH_ENHANCED_CAN_HAL</tt> select enhanced CAN processing
	- <tt>USE_LITTLE_ENDIAN_CPU</tt> enables several optimizations of number conversions, when a little endian CPU is used. Switch this flag to <tt>off</tt> when you use a big endian CPU.
    - <tt>USE_CAN_DRIVER</tt> CAN driver to use from list <tt>{ "simulating"|"sys"|"msq_server"|"socket_server" }</tt>,
        - where type "simulating" uses file based CAN simulation on each PC system target,
        - "msq_server": use Linux message queues for communicating to the CAN server (target "pc_linux" only)
        - "socket_server": use sockets for communicating to the CAN server (target "pc_linux" and "pc_win32")
        - The other embedded targets allow only the system specific CAN driver - identified by "sys"
        - update_makefile.sh automatically selects the "sys" CAN driver, if no PC target is selected
    - <tt>USE_CAN_DEVICE_FOR_SERVER</tt> CAN device used by CAN server application <tt>{ "no_card"|"pcan"|"A1"|"rte"|"sontheim"|"vector_canlib"|"vector_xl }</tt>,
        - for target "pc_win32" only "no_card" is allowed, because the CAN server application has it's own, CAN card specific project files (see ScriptIntegrateWin32Can)
        - for target "pc_linux" the allowed values are <tt>{ "no_card"|"pcan"|"A1"|"rte" }</tt>. The resulting Makefile will build the \isoaglib application and also the CAN card specific CAN server application.
	- <tt>USE_RS232_DRIVER</tt> RS232 driver to use from list <tt>{ "simulating"|"sys"|"rte" }</tt>
        - where type "simulating" uses file based RS232 simulation on each PC system target,
        - "sys" uses the native RS232 of every target
        - and "rte" uses the RS232 interface of the RTE system
        - <tt>update_makefile.sh</tt> automatically selects the "sys" RS232 driver, if no PC target is selected
	- <tt>CAN_BUS_CNT</tt> count of available CAN BUSes at target - default 1
	- <tt>CAN_INSTANCE_CNT</tt> count of CAN channels which shall be supported by \isoaglib (the application can also use the extended CAN
	                          features of \isoaglib so that e.g. channel 0 can be used for protocol and channel 1 for internal CAN communication)<br>
	                          Must be smaller or equal as <tt>CAN_BUS_CNT</tt>.
	- <tt>PRT_INSTANCE_CNT</tt> count of CAN channels where the communication protocol shall be supported - the \isoaglib can be used as gateway to
	                          route traffic between the connected CAN interfaces
	- <tt>RS232_INSTANCE_CNT</tt> defines amount of RS232 instances that are supported in parallel. When the ECU shall communicate on more than one channel, this variable has to be adapted to the channel amount.

\subsubsection ConfCoreComm Core Communication Setup
Setup of most important communication features:
	- <tt>PRJ_ISO11783</tt> selection of ISO 11783 protocol in the project
	- <tt>PRJ_ISO_TERMINAL</tt> selection of ISO 11783 Virtual Terminal support (only available if PRJ_ISO11783 is activated)
    - <tt>PRJ_MULTIPACKET</tt> will be set automatically by depending features like PRJ_ISO_TERMINAL
    - <tt>PRJ_BASE</tt> gather base data like tractor speed, distance, ISO GPS, PTO RPM from BUS and make them available independent of receive time
	- <tt>PRJ_MULTIPACKET_STREAM_CHUNK</tt> allows to specify the preferred way of receiving multi message data streams. If chunk (default) mode is active,
	     the application can perform a parsing on-the-fly of each received burst. This allows to reduce the RAM useage for large
			 data streams. But in case all data are parsed just after complete receive of all data bye, the <b>linear</b> receive mode
			 is better. So switch chunk mode <b>off</b> in those cases.

\subsubsection ConProcData Process Data Communication Setup
Setup of process data support:
	- <tt>PRJ_PROCESS</tt> overall activation of process data support
	- <tt>PROC_LOCAL</tt> overall activation of local process data - local means that the corresponding ECU measures the data which can be requested by remote ECUs
		- <tt>PROC_LOCAL_STD</tt> select standard local process data IsoAgLib::iProcDataLocal_c with measure programs and enhanced management of received setpoints
		- <tt>PROC_LOCAL_SIMPLE_MEASURE</tt> select IsoAgLib::iProcDataLocalSimpleMeasure_c for local process data without measure programs to reduce
		     HEAP useage (all measurement programs are stored on HEAP, as amount of active programs depend on remote ECUs)
		- <tt>PROC_LOCAL_SIMPLE_SETPOINT</tt> select IsoAgLib::iProcDataLocalSimpleSetpoint_c for local process data without selective reaction on received setpoints
		     (simply store received setpoints and automatically ACK the receive of a setpoint)
		- <tt>PROC_LOCAL_SIMPLE_MEASURE_SETPOINT</tt> select IsoAgLib::iProcDataLocalSimpleSetpointSimpleMeasure_c for local process data with smallest resource needs - and most
		     restricted feature set
	- <tt>PROC_REMOTE</tt> overall activation of remote process data - remote means that the corresponding ECU requests measurement data from a remote ECU
		- <tt>PROC_REMOTE_STD</tt> select IsoAgLib::iProcDataRemote_c for remote process data which can use measure programs to request periodic measurement value update
		     and which provides setpoint management which can detect current master setpoint (setpoint which is ACKed by commanded device) and the self
		     requested value (information if own setpoint is ACKed and if own requested setpoint interval is currently maintained by remote
		     device - this can happen if intersection between ACKed setpoint request and own setpoint request is _not_ empty, so that commanded implement can
		     satisfy both)
		- <tt>PROC_REMOTE_SIMPLE_MEASURE</tt> select IsoAgLib::iProcDataRemoteSimpleMeasure_c if capable setpoint management is needed, but simple one shot measurement value request is enough
		     (reduce HEAP useage, as the potential parallel active increments are stored in dynamic lists at HEAP)
		- <tt>PROC_REMOTE_SIMPLE_SETPOINT</tt> select IsoAgLib::iProcDataRemoteSimpleSetpoint_c if measurement programs are needed, but no or only simple setpoint control is wanted
		     (reduce memory useage, as no management data is needed for detection of active setpoint in relation to own setpoint wish)
		- <tt>PROC_REMOTE_SIMPLE_MEASURE_SETPOINT</tt> select IsoAgLib::iProcDataRemoteSimpleSetpointSimpleMeasure_c if only one shot measurement value requests and no setpoint handling is needed
		     (in relation to IsoAgLib::iProcDataRemoteSimpleSetpointSimpleMeasureCombined_c the single setpoint and the single measurement value can represent
		     different values)
		- <tt>PROC_REMOTE_SIMPLE_MEASURE_SETPOINT_COMBINED</tt> select IsoAgLib::iProcDataRemoteSimpleSetpointSimpleMeasureCombined_c for a very simple approach on remote process data.
		     This is only useful if no distinguishing between setpoint and measurement value is needed

\subsubsection ConfOptDriver Optional Driver Selection
The \isoaglib needs for basic communication service only access to core system functions like time (optional
trigger watchdog) and CAN. But as the author used it also for other I/O types during the initiating research project, and as
some other I/Os can deliver some important additional features to \isoaglib core components, they are also
provided - and can be selected by the following configuration variables.
	- <tt>PRJ_EEPROM</tt> select if the EEPROM driver shall be used, to read/write EEPROM data from within the \isoaglib. This is important for local
		   process data, as \isoaglib can store intermediate values in EEPROM so that the value can be re-read on each system startup
		   (important for cumulative values like distance, when the application has only to calculate the distance increments of the
		   current working session, and the \isoaglib provides the cumulated value on BUS;<br>
		   it's also important to store the current SA on ISO 11783 address claim
		   --> try to reuse SA os last working session on next system start.<br>
		   the application has only to specify to EEPROM address to handle the SA;
		   \isoaglib takes then care of storing and reloading the SA)
	- <tt>PRJ_DATASTREAMS</tt> enables HAL based file I/O, so that applications with file access can be easily ported between targets with different methods for file access.
	- <tt>PRJ_RS232</tt> select IsoAgLib::iRS232IO_c for RS232 output which can be used like the standard C++ iostreams
	- <tt>PRJ_RS232_OVER_CAN</tt> provides a special RS232 HAL, that uses CAN messaging for sending and receiving RS232 messages.
	- <tt>PRJ_SENSOR_DIGITAL</tt> select IsoAgLib::iDigitalO_c (one instance/variable of this class per channel) for digital On/Off input
	     (provides automatic range check which uses diagnose function of HAL - BIOS/OS - to check if current is in allowed interval);
	     use IsoAgLib::iActorO_c for global access to all active IsoAgLib::iDigitalO_c instances
	- <tt>PRJ_SENSOR_ANALOG</tt> select IsoAgLib::iAnalogI_c for analog (current or voltage) sensor input or IsoAgLib::iAnalogIRangeCheck_c with enhanced automatic range check
	- <tt>PRJ_SENSOR_COUNTER</tt> select IsoAgLib::iCounterI_c for counter input. the existing HAL implementations (e.g. for ESX) extend the BIOS/OS
	     function, as a \isoaglib specific event counting for very low event repetition rates is provided - the BIOS version is only
	     designed for typical RPM values
	- <tt>PRJ_ACTOR</tt> select if the digital output driver shall be integrated into the project. you can then use the HAL of \isoaglib to realize a mostly hardware independent
	     access on PWM output. This is completely independent from communication tasks, but was created during research and is actively used by OSB AG for its own
	     projects

\subsubsection ConfBuildLinux Build System Configuration for Linux
The update_makefile.sh script should find all needed helper programs on its own.

\subsubsection ConfBuildEde Build System Configuration for Cross Compilers (like TASKING EDE)
Configuration options typical for embedded project (these are used for target systems like "esx", "imi", "pm167")
where the system libraries aren't placed in standard directories (UNIX/Linux has standard directories <tt>/usr/include</tt>, <tt>/usr/local/include</tt>, <tt>/usr/lib</tt>
and <tt>/usr/local/lib</tt> -> \isoaglib awaits the libraries in this directories for UNIX/Linux).<br>
These settings are at the moment only used for project generation of
	- TASKING EDE

The following config variables should match the need of most cross compilers:
	- <tt>USE_EMBED_COMPILER_DIR</tt> path to the embedded compiler
	- <tt>USE_EMBED_LIB_DIRECTORY</tt> path (relative to \isoaglib root or absolute)
	     to the libraries of the embedded BIOS / OS (please seperate entries by whitespace and use only UNIX style directory seperator "/")
	- <tt>USE_EMBED_HEADER_DIRECTORY</tt> path (relative to \isoaglib root or absolute)
	     to the headers of the embedded BIOS / OS (please seperate entries by whitespace and use only UNIX style directory seperator "/")
	- <tt>USE_EMBED_LIBS</tt> needed library files (please seperate entries by whitespace)
	- <tt>USE_EMBED_BIOS_SRC</tt> special source files from the BIOS/OS which must be inserted into the sources list
	     (e.g. startup files which could be delivered as asm file and must be compiled during runtime,
	     as the BIOS/OS allows there some individual adaptation) (please seperate entries by whitespace)
	- <tt>USE_EMBED_ILO</tt> linker / locater control file which defines HEAPSIZE and other important project specific target settings for link time

\subsubsection ConfBuildWin32 Build System Configuration for Win32 (like Visual C++ and Dev-C++)
<!--The update_makefile.sh script can create project files for Visual C++ (DSP) and Dev-C++.
As the Open Souce IDE Dev-C++ is really good, it is strong recommended to use to compile the vt2iso tool.
But the driver DLLs for Vector-Informatik CAN cards don't interact with Dev-C++ built EXE programs.
So update_makefile.sh was extended to write DSP project files, which are meant for VC6 and can be imported
into newer version of Microsoft Visual Studio VC++.<br>
As VC6 version of the <b>S</b>tandard <b>T</b>emplate <b>L</b>ibrary is really not standard conformant, you need
to install STLport as described in \ref Vc6StlPort. Please specify the path to STLport, if you didn't place it into <tt>C:\\</tt> and rename STLport-3.6.2 to STLport:
	- <tt>USE_STLPORT_HEADER_DIRECTORY</tt> directory to the <i>stlport</i> directory within the STLport package - the C++ headers are located there
	- <tt>USE_STLPORT_LIBRARY_DIRECTORY</tt> path to STLport libraries in case you selected the option to use the STLport version of IOSTREAMS (and not the native version as advised by the doc at \ref Vc6StlPort)
	    let empty if native IOSTREAMS library is used

The next configuration variables are needed for Vector-Informatik and Sontheim CAN cards.
As Vector-Informatik provides two types of programming libraries which can be used for the same cards, the
\isoaglib reflects this option. To ease directory management, \isoaglib
awaits the potentially parallel installed versions rooted in the same parent directory.<br>
E.g when you selected "C:/Development" as base directory during the SETUP of both CAN program linbraries,
you will get
	- the CANLIB driver in <tt>C:/Development/CANLIB</tt>
	- the XL Driver Library in <tt>C:/Development/XL Driver Library</tt>

Manually extract the Sontheim API files to <tt>C:/Development/Sontheim</tt>.

Now \isoaglib can access all of them if you specify:
	- <tt>USE_WIN32_LIB_DIRECTORY="C:/Development"</tt>,
	- <tt>USE_WIN32_HEADER_DIRECTORY="C:/Development"</tt>

which is the default setting. The script <tt>update_makefile.sh</tt> will find all versions of the driver.

The \isoaglib HAL adaptation to the Vector-Informatik CAN driver can be configured by the configuration file
for a specific hardware type (list <tt>{ HWTYPE_VIRTUAL|HWTYPE_CANCARDX|HWTYPE_CANAC2|HWTYPE_CANAC2PCI }</tt> - the XL driver
places the "XL_" string in front of the card type name, so that both CANLIB and XL can be used with the same conf_* type names).
As a special option, \isoaglib can use all real hardware channels it finds, so that your EXE can be flexibly
used for different CAN card types of Vector-Informatik. You can use this option, if you select <tt>HWTYPE_AUTO</tt> as hardware
type. In case only the Vector-Informatik Virtual Channel is found, then these typically two channels are used instead.<br>
The Sontheim CAN card driver should be used also with the automatic CAN card type detection. This is realized by testing the API init for
a list of supported CAN card types. As soon as the API is successfully initialized for one CAN card type, that type is used.<br>
-->
The update_makefile.sh script can create project files for Visual C++ ( DSP ) and Dev-C++.
As the Open Souce IDE Dev-C++ is really good, it is strong recommended to use to compile the vt2iso tool.

<!--As VC6 version of the <b>S</b>tandard <b>T</b>emplate <b>L</b>ibrary is really not standard conformant, you need
to install STLport as described in \ref Vc6StlPort. Please specify the path to STLport, if you didn't place it into <i>C:\\</i> and rename STLport-3.6.2 to STLport:
    - <b>USE_STLPORT_HEADER_DIRECTORY</b> directory to the <i>stlport</i> directory within the STLport package - the C++ headers are located there
    - <b>USE_STLPORT_LIBRARY_DIRECTORY</b> path to STLport libraries in case you selected the option to use the STLport version of IOSTREAMS ( and not the native version as advised by the doc at \ref Vc6StlPort )
        let empty if native IOSTREAMS library is used

\section InstallIsoToolVt2Iso Installing vt2iso - Tool for Creation of ISO 11783 Virtual Terminal Masks
The \isoaglib provides a complete Open Source Tool Chain for ISO 11783 virtual terminals.
<b>First of all, you don't have to build vt2iso, as an EXE file is also part of the downloaded archive.</b><br>
But if you like to test some changes, or simply want to rebuild from the current repository version, you need to perform
the following build process.<br>

A very important part is the tool <tt>vt2iso</tt> which parses the XML mask definition files and creates
ROMable constant declarations for all used virtual terminal objects, which can be easily uploaded to the terminal
(see at the corresponding tutorial for more information on this).

<b>Remark for Win32 users:</b> special installation and usage instructions can be found in <tt>INSTALL.Win32.txt</tt> in the <tt>vt2iso</tt> directory.

\subsection InstallFreeImage Install Image Manipulation Library Free Image
The <tt>vt2iso</tt> can read almost all types of bitmaps to get the compileable variable array representation
of bitmaps for the ECU. Those operations are greatly supported by the Open Source libraries <tt>FreeImage</tt>
and <tt>Paintlib</tt> (http://www.paintlib.de/paintlib/) (alternative - choose the library that is easier to install for you).<br>
Vt2iso uses these libraries to access the color values of all pixels (and to convert from palettized / indexed formats
if needed) so that the needed conversion to the chosen color depth can be performed.
Vt2iso uses an automatic calculation of a threshold to get the highest contrast in the picture (optimum 50:50 relation between
black and white).<br>
\subsubsection FreeImageLinux Installation of Free Image Library on Linux
For Linux users <tt>libfreeimage.a</tt> is included in the repository so that further compilation is not required anymore
(<tt>vt2iso/../libs/freeimage</tt>).
<!--The FreeImage library can be best compiled from source for Linux (simple to compile with make based on
provided Makefile).
Please make sure that the library and include files are installed to system directories (need root user to install)
or adapt the Makefiles on your own (no support by author for this config).
The FreeImage library may also be available as a ready made binary distribution.-->

\subsubsection FreeImageWin32 Installation of Free Image Library on Win32
On Win32 Platform the Dev-C++ IDE provides a very simple download as extension package from within the program. 
Thus you have no installation afford with any make or manual install (see \ref InstallDevCpp).
In case you still want to use Visual Studio, you can use the prvided project file <tt>vt2iso.vcproj</tt> together
with the files from the repository (<tt>vt2iso/../libs/freeimage</tt>). Be sure that you have the MS Platform SDK
installed (see CompDevVc6).

(Remark: As this program is only running on development PC, the compiler needn't be able to generate
  code for embedded platforms -> TASKING not needed for this on Win32)

\subsection InstallXerces Install XML Parser Library Xerces of the Apache Foundation
The parsing of the XML files is performed by the Xerces library from apache, which can be downloaded from
http://xml.apache.org/xerces-c/index.html .

\subsubsection LinuxXerces Installation of Xerces-C on Linux
Most of the Linux distributions provide a binary package for Xerces-C which can be easily installed from within the
distribution specific package manager. Select at least a Xerces-C package which contains libxerces-c.so.2* and
the corresponding headers in /usr/include/xercesc/ (or /usr/local/include/xercesc/).

\subsubsection Win32Xerces Installation of Xerces-C on Windows
- <b>Dev-C++</b>
  - Download the Dev-C++ prepared binary of Xerces-C from http://devpaks.org/show.php?devpak=41
  - Call the packagemanager for Dev-C++ (menu TOOLS->PACKAGE MANAGER) and select
    the downloaded archive xerces-c_2_5_0-mingw.DevPak for install
- <b>Visual Studio</b><br> 
  Download Xerces-C++ v2.5.0.0 from <a href="http://archive.apache.org/dist/xml/xerces-c/Xerces-C_2_5_0/xerces-c_2_5_0-windows_nt-msvc_60.zip">here</a>
and extract it properly(!) to <tt>vt2iso\\..\\libs\\</tt>
- <b>Attention!</b><br>The xerces-c_2_5_0.dll that was included with the Dev-Cpp package is NOT the
  same as the one you can download from apache.org!! Therefore you can get an inproper procedurecall 
  messages when starting vt2iso using the wrong dll! So be sure to always use the correct dll.


\subsection CompileVt2Iso Compiling vt2iso
\subsubsection CompileVt2IsoLinux Compiling vt2iso on Linux
-# <tt>cd build_utils/vt2iso</tt>
-# <tt>make</tt>

\subsubsection CompileVt2IsoWin32 Compiling VT2Iso on Win32

- Dev-C++:
-# Install first Dev-C++ with the library packages FreeImage and ImageLib
-# Install Xerces-C (see above)
-# Open the Dev-C++ project file build_utils/vt2iso/Vt2Iso.dev
-# Start project compile
-# Copy the dll's xerces-c_2_5_0.dll and FreeImage.dll to a place where Vt2Iso.exe
   can find them if you execute the EXE (e.g. same directory as EXE or system directory)
   or extend the PATH. As <a href="mailto:Achim.Spangler_at_osb-ag:de">Achim Spangler</a> is very seldom using Win32 development tools,
   he asks you to check other resources on how to manage dll placement.<br>
- Visual Studio (2005):
-# Be sure that the libraries and includes for freeimage and xerces are in the proper locations
-# Be sure that the MS Platform SDK is installed
-# Modify include and or library paths to match your system's settings if needed
-# Open vt2ios.vcproj and create a debug or release build.
-# The dll files will be copied to the <tt>vt2iso\\bin_vc</tt> directory if installed correctly

<b>Remark for Win32 users:</b> special installation and usage instructions can be found in <tt>INSTALL.Win32.txt</tt> in the <tt>vt2iso</tt> directory.


\subsection UseVt2Iso Creating mask definitions with vt2iso
You can find the description of the XML syntax which is used by vt2iso at \ref XMLspec .<br>
An example mask pool is defined for the example 3_0_VirtualTerminalIso.cpp . Some handler functions are also demonstrated there.<br>
The automatic generation itself is triggered by a call like described in the script build_utils/vt2iso-3-0_VirtualTerminalIso.sh (Linux)
or build_utils/vt2iso-3-0_VirtualTerminalIso.bat (Win32).
This script/BAT results in suitable files with constant variable array definition for include into the main souce
file of a project (in this example in examples/tutorial/3_Terminal/3_0_VirtualTerminalIso/MaskDefinition/).
