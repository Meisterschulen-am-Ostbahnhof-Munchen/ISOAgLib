 * that will run the ISOAgLib Scheduler main-loop
 *
 * If multiple modules start/stop the "thread", it will internally
 * be matched to only one single thread being running.
 *
 * The caller won't know if he actually started the thread or if it
 * was already running (he gets the same result "startSuccess")
 *
 * Passing a "key" secures double start-calls or things alike.
 *
 * NOTE: Only 1 ISOBUS Instance is supported by this class currently.
 *       It is still an open discussion if BUS/System-Init should belong
 *       into this class or not though...
